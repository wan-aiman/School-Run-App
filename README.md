# School Run App

## Project Overview
The School Run App is designed to streamline the daily drop-off and pick-up process for students using a smart, automated system. By integrating sensors and actuators, the app ensures that student attendance is accurately recorded, and students are promptly notified when their ride arrives.

## Features
- **Drop-off Detection**: Automatically updates a student's attendance upon arrival.
- **Pick-up Notification**: Notifies students when their registered ride is ready for pick-up.
- **Unregistered Vehicle Handling**: Prompts action when an unregistered vehicle is detected.

## System Flow
1. The app prompts the user to select either drop-off or pick-up.
2. The user enters the student ID.
3. If the ID matches the database:
   - For drop-off, the student's attendance is marked as present.
   - For pick-up, the student is notified of their ride.
4. If the ID does not match, the user is prompted to retry or contact the school admin.
